I take model from there: https://www.kaggle.com/jhoward/nb-svm-strong-linear-baseline and dumps from https://archive.org/details/stackexchange.

Save models to pickles - toxic.py

Save info from xml(Text, Score, Tags) dump to dict(json):
 - save_year_posts.py
 - save_year_comments.py
 
 Evaluate toxicity:
  - evaluate_texts.py
